This repository contains a Python notebook for classifying small images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow and Keras.

Overview:
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. This notebook demonstrates the process of loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, building and training a CNN model, and evaluating its performance.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Matplotlib
NumPy
sklearn

Installation:
Install the required dependencies:

pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy scikit-learn

Usage:

1.Open the Jupyter notebook small_image_classification_cnn.ipynb in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
2.Execute each cell sequentially to load the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
3.Explore the results and experiment with different configurations to further improve the model's performance if desired.

File Structure:

1.small_image_classification_cnn.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for small image classification using CNN.
2.README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
3.requirements.txt: File listing all dependencies required to run the notebook.
